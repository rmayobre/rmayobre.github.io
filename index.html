									At a young age, I started studying classical guitar. I found myself obsessed with picking up new techniques and learning
									new songs. In high school, I was accepted into the advanced guitar program. During my senior year of high school, I
									performed a classical piece in front of the professors at Yale University. Playing guitar helped me to become focused and 
									interested in the technical aspects of music.

									One day, I noticed my phone was having issues. It would reboot at the start of every phone call. The manufacture of the 
									phone wouldn't fix it, so the solution was for me to fix it myself. I skimmed through a developer's forum and found a post 
									someone left, detailing the exact issues I was having and provided a solution. Focused and interested in the technical 
									aspects of the solution, my phone was fixed and I was hooked. It was time for me to put down the guitar for a while and 
									learn how to build a computer!

						<h2>My Experience</h2>
						<p>...comes from my passion.</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						After high school, I attended Northern Virginia Community College for two years and transferred to Radford University in 2014. It
						was at Radford where things really started moving for me. Computer Science became my concentration along with a minor in mathematics.
						Security became an interest, so I took extra classes to receive the University's Security Certification. During my senior year I got
						an internship with a start-up company, which allowed me to design and develop a mobile application for it.

					</header>
					<p>
						In my personal time, I continue to build my own projects and study all things computer-related. I enjoy sharing the
						things I've learned over the years and have even write tutorials. I've studied a broad range of Android development, 
						server-side Spring applications, and even advance Linux virtualization. I use what I've learned to continue my 
						projects and share through my tutorials. I don't plan on stopping soon. My GitHub is always being updated, and my 
						repo list continues to grow.
