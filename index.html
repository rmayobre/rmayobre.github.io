									At a young age, I started studying classical guitar. I found myself obsessed with picking up new techniques and learning
									new songs. In high school, I was accepted into the advanced guitar program. In my senior year of high school, I
									performed a classical piece in front of the professors of Yale University. One day, I noticed my phone was having issues.

							<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">

									It would reboot at the start of every phone call. The manufactors wouldn't fix it, so 
									the solution was for me to fix it myself. I skimmed through a developers forum and found a post someone left, detailing
									the exact issues I was having and provided a solution. My phone was fixed and I was hooked. It was time for me to put 
									down the guitar for a while and study computers; therefore, I built one.

						<h2>My Experience</h2>
						<p>...comes from my passion.</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						After high school, I attended Northern Virginia Community College for two years and then transfered to Radford in 2014. It
						was in Radford where things really started moving for me. Computer Science became my concentration and Mathematics was my minor.
						Security became an interest, so I took extra classes to recieve the University's Security Certification. In my senor year I
						got an internship, and spent most of my time designing and developing a mobile application for a start up company.

						<h2>My Projects</h2>
						<p>...take up my personal time.</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						In my personal time, I continue to build my own projects and study all things computer-related. I enjoy sharing the
						things I've learned over the years and even write tutorials. I've studied a broad range of Android development, 
						server-side Spring applications, and even advance Linux virtualization. I use what I've learned to continue my 
						projects and share through my tutorials. I don't plan on stopping soon. My GitHub is always being updated, and my 
						repo list continues to grow.
